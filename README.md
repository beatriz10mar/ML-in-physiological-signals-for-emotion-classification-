# Machine-learning-in-physiological-signals-for-emotion-classification-

This work was developed in ieeta, under the project ?, in the context of the thesis "Machine Learning in physiological signals for emotional classification". It aims to develop a machine learning algorithm, more specirficaly a SVM model, to identify emotions (Fear, Happy, Neutral) and their level of intensity, through the information of the physiological signals ECG, EDA and EMG of a subject.

This repository is organized into different tasks that were carried out throughout the work:

Starting with extracting and cleaning of the data
Time Series Feature Extraction
Application of different dimensionality reduction and clustering methods
Analysis of clusters
